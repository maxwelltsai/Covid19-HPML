# CT
This folder contains the projects related to CT images for COVID-19. It consists of sub folders with different approaches for using CT-images for performing COVID-19 detection on CT-images. Each sub folder has its own README file explaining how to use that specific sub folder. 

The main work on the CT part of this github repository was done by Joris. For questions about the CT approaches, please contact joris.mollinga@surfsara.nl
